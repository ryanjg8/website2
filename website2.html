<h1  class="header">General relativity</h1>
<p id="gr">General Relativity is a theory that was created by German Physics Albert Einstein and is the most accepted and experimentally accurate theory of gravity that we have today. It is such an important theory that sadelates , spaceships and GPS need special algorithms to compensate for General relativity in order to work accurately. General relativity describes gravity as a three dimensional fabric like plane called the fabric of spacetime. General relativity says that when something with mass or energy is placed in this spacetime fabric, spacetime will bend and warp around the object. If two or more objects with mass are placed in this fabric the warped fabric will cause the two objects to move towards each other this effect is known as gravity. A simpler explanation of this is that objects with mass cause space time to move in respect to this space time causes objects to move inside it. An analogy often used to demonstrate General relativity is this. Imaginative you have a stretched out bed sheet if you placed a heavy ball on that sheet the ball will bend the sheet around the ball, this is like the bending of space time fabric. Now imagine you add another ball to the sheet, just like the other ball the sheet will bend and warp around the ball however because you added the first ball the warps in the sheet will cause the balls to move towards each other, this is gravity. While this is a very good explanation of gravity it is not extremely accurate in reality gravity works at infinite ranges and uses 3 dimensions instead of a 2D sheet.

<h1  class="header">Quantum mechanics</h1>
<p id="qm"> Quantum Mechanics sometimes called matrix mechanics or Quantum Physics is a theory of modern physics that describes extremely small subatomic particles on the smallest possible levels of energy called quanta. Quantum mechanics is the base if many other fundamental theories in physics including Quantum Thermodynamics (QTD), Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), Quantum Field Theory (QFT), String Theory, Quantum chromodynamics (QCD), and many other theories. Quantum Physics also describes 3 out of the 4 fundamental forces of nature (Weak Force, Strong Force, and Electromagnetism), predictably describes all currently known fundamental particles, and is the most experimental accurate model of physics known to date, the only force it can't describe is gravity. This causes many problems in modern physics (mostly with General Relativity) because without gravity our understanding of Quantum physics no longer works beyond subatomic scales. This is mainly due to things like Quantum superposition, heisenberg's uncertainty principle, and wave particle duality. Some of the main ideas that quantum mechanics suggests are concepts like quantum superposition and wave particle duality. Both these ideas together create a law of physics known as Heisenberg's uncertainty principle (something that will be very important later on). Together these principles says that fundamental particles exist as both a wave and a particle at the same time until they are observed and the quantum waveform collapses. This is called wave particle duality and points the the idea that the act of observing something will cause it to change this is often shown in the simple double slit experiment or quantum eraser experiment. The second thing these principles state is that while a particle is in a wave like state the particle will exist in all possible states of configuration and positions all at the same time. This is called quantum superposition and is responsible for something called quantum tunneling which is one of two examples of real life, experimentally proven ways of teleportation, the other one being quantum teleportation.

<h1  class="header">The problem</h1>
<p id="prob">Both Quantum mechanics and general relativity work accurately when separate however a problem arises when the two theories are united. If there were some way to unite the two we would essentially have a theory of everything that could accurately predict everything in the known universe, including singularity like objects, however there is currently no theory that can unite the two without implying infinity and singularity type objects (these things violate all laws of physics and can’t exist). This is partly because quantum mechanics describes gravity as a fundamental force of nature while general relativity describes it as a effect of curvature in spacetime but is mostly because General relativity <strong> only works for objects with mass and an absolute position </strong>,while most fundamental particles have mass it is impossible for any fundamental particle to have an absolute position while in a quantum state this is because of a principle called the Heisenberg uncertainty principle (see quantum mechanics section for a through explanation). The Heisenberg uncertainty principle says that because of wave particle duality and quantum superposition it is impossible to know the position and momentum of a subatomic particle at any given moment. Because of this it is impossible to have a one hundred percent accurate measurement of a particle’s position. Something that Generally relativity needs, which means that the two most important and accurate theories ever created can’t work which means that we will never have a theory of everything and will never be able to accurately describe everything. Now you may be thinking why does General relativity need absolute position anyways and cant we just remove the idea that it needs absolute position and have a theory of everything. The answer is kind of but not really (this is explained later in Quantum loop theory) but first the reason why General relativity needs absolute position. General relativity says that when mass is placed in space time fabric it will bend and warp. This space time fabric is smooth and continuous kind of like a wave.Which means that there must be an infinite amount of quantized data between each particle, kind of like an analog wave but with the fabric of spacetime. A basic way to explain this is imagine you have two particles each suspended in the space time fabric if you move the two particles together the space between them decreases. General relativity says that no matter how close you move the two particles they won’t change their spots so the particle on the right will stay on the right as long as you keep it on the right and vise versa. This logically makes sense and works very well in the real world however a problem arises when the two particles are subatomic. At first it would seem that the same principles apply, the particles will move closer and closer and closer but never actually switch position. This however does not happen, if you remember from before heisenberg's uncertainty principle says that it is impossible to be one hundred percent accurate about a particle’s position, it also states that particles exist in all different positions along their quantum waveform. This means that if you moved the two subatomic particles close enough the quantum wave forms would overlap each other and if the particles were to be measured at this time their waveforms would collapse and the subatomic particles would have a highly unlikely but not impossible probability of switching places. This idea only applies to subatomic particles but still has been proven correctly over and over multiple times in particle physics experiments even though it goes directly against General relativity and almost all of our current knowledge of physics but somehow works and has been proven to be correct over and over.

<h1  class="header">String theory</h1>
<p id="st"> 
String theory often called superstring theory is a theory that describes all fundamental particles as vibrating looped strings hence the name. String theory says that all fundamental particles are made of vibrating strings of energy each a planck length long. String theory says that vibrating a string at a certain frequency will produce a certain particle on the standard model of modern particle physics. The standard model is basically a list of fundamental particles divided into two parts, bosons and fermions (and the Higgs field but that’s not an actual particle, it’s a field). You can think of bosons as force carrying like particles this includes gluons for the strong force, photons for the electromagnetic force, w Bosons for the weak force, the Higgs boson for the Higgs field, and the theoretical graviton for gravity (only correct if String theory is true). Then there are fermions, the actual particles that the bosons interact with these include quarks and leptons. String theory basically says that all strings are identical to one another the only difference is how they vibrate and that each vibrating string has its own unique dimensional plain. For example a string that vibrates for a electron will have its own dimensional range ex: the sixth dimension. While a muon will vibrate on a fifth dimensional level it's kind of like quantum field theory just with extra dimensions except the strings are like the fields and the fields are the now dimensions(kind of). If you want a better understanding of string theory click the ted talk link under the sources below. This may not sound like much but string theory is the theoretical solution to the graviton (boson for gravity). Before string theory physics tried to add a graviton to the standard model and they got a bunch of infinity’s this is manly because of something called renormalization where General relativity can’t be renormalized but quantum physics can be. This won’t be important to understand string theory but it’s still good to know some background information. What string theory does is it renormalized the graviton so now there is a particle that can carry the gravity force which means the math behind general relativity is already built into string theory, so then why no bingo theory of everything. At first string theory seems like a simple theory that could solve the theory of everything, but one could say that string theory comes with a lot of strings attached. For example since string theory implies higher level dimensions the math that we use for our easy three dimensional ideas no longer works. In fact the math behind string theory doesn’t even start to work until we apply it to 10th dimensional simulations, not only that but we have no way to be expremetly test string theory.

<h1  class="header">Loop quantum gravity</h1>
<p id="lqg"> One theory that tries to fix this is loop quantum gravity. Loop quantum gravity says that general relativity is correct to say that adding mass to space time will cause it to curve but says that space time fabric is not actually infinite but is actually divided into small sections. This small sections are called quanta and are the smallest possible unit of measurement. These quanta are extremely small, around 1x10^-35 meters each one being one planck length long. Because of this loop quantum gravity could, in theory unite the two theories together because if space time is no longer has infinite precision but can instead be measured chunks. To explain this better let’s go back to the particle anogly described in the above section. If loop gravity is in fact correct than you would not be able to move the two particles closer and closer and still have an infinite amount of data between the particles since space is now quantized. This means that general relativity can now account for quantum superposition since space is quantized a a subatomic particle can’t have an infinite amount of possible positions but instead can only have a superposition state of all of the possible quantized positions in the quantum waveform. Which in turn means that when the particle is measured it will now have a definite position and therefore creating a theory of everything. Now if this theory works then why is there no theory of everything. It’s because that's all it is, a theory, that so far can’t be proven correct or not. This is mainly because we have no way to measure and experiment whether this theory is correct or not. Since we can’t measure planck length with our current technology we have no way to know if planck length space exists and therefore have no way to know if loop quantum gravity is correct.
