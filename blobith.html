<h1  class="header">General relativity</h1>
<p id="gr">General Relativity is a theory that was created by German Physics Albert Einstein and is the most accepted and experimentally accurate theory of gravity that we have today. It is such an important theory that satellites, spaceships and GPS need special algorithms to compensate for General relativity in order to work accurately. General relativity describes gravity as a three dimensional fabric like plane called the fabric of spacetime. General relativity says that when something with mass or energy is placed in this spacetime fabric, spacetime will bend and warp around the object. If two or more objects with mass are placed in this fabric the warped fabric will cause the two objects to move towards each other. This effect is known as gravity.the following analogy is often used to demonstrate General relativity. Imaginative you have a stretched out bed sheet. If you placed a heavy ball on that sheet, the ball will bend the sheet around the ball. This is like the bending of space time fabric. Now imagine you add another ball to the sheet. Just like the other ball, the sheet will bend and warp around the ball. However, because you added the first ball, the warps in the sheet will cause the balls to move towards each other. This is gravity. While this is a very good explanation of gravity, it is not extremely accurate. In reality, gravity works at infinite ranges and uses 3 dimensions instead of a 2D sheet.

<h1  class="header">Quantum mechanics</h1>
<p id="qm"> Quantum Mechanics, sometimes called matrix mechanics or Quantum Physics, is a theory of modern physics that describes extremely small subatomic particles on the smallest possible levels of energy called quanta. Quantum mechanics is the base of many other fundamental theories in physics including Quantum Thermodynamics (QTD), Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), Quantum Field Theory (QFT), String Theory, Quantum chromodynamics (QCD), and many other theories. Quantum Physics also describes 3 out of the 4 fundamental forces of nature (Weak Force, Strong Force, and Electromagnetism). It also predictably describes all of the currently known fundamental particles, and is the most experimentally accurate model of physics known to date. The only force it can't describe is gravity. This causes many problems in modern physics (mostly with General Relativity) because without gravity our understanding of Quantum physics no longer works beyond subatomic scales. This is mainly due to things like Quantum superposition, heisenberg's uncertainty principle, and wave particle duality. Some of the main ideas that quantum mechanics suggests are concepts like quantum superposition and wave particle duality. Both these ideas together create a law of physics known as Heisenberg's uncertainty principle (something that will be very important later on). Together these principles says that fundamental particles exist as both a wave and a particle at the same time until they are observed and the quantum waveform collapses. This is called wave particle duality and points the idea that the act of observing something will cause it to change. This is often shown in the simple double slit experiment, or quantum eraser experiment. The second thing these principles state is that while a particle is in a wave like state, the particle will exist in all possible states of configuration and positions all at the same time. This is called quantum superposition and is responsible for something called quantum tunneling which is one of two examples of real life ways of teleportation. The other example of teleportation being quantum teleportation.

<span class="imgtext">The basic ideas of Quantum mechanics</span>

<h1  class="header">The problem</h1>
<p id="prob">Both Quantum mechanics and general relativity work accurately when separated. However a problem arises when the two theories are united. If there were some way to unite the two, we would essentially have a theory of everything that could accurately predict everything in the known universe. However, there is currently no theory that can unite the two without implying infinity and singularity type objects (these things violate all laws of physics and can’t exist).This is because General relativity <strong> only works for objects with mass and an absolute position </strong>. While most fundamental particles have mass, it is impossible for any fundamental particle to have an absolute position while in a quantum state. This is because of a principle called the Heisenberg uncertainty principle (see quantum mechanics section for better explanation). The Heisenberg uncertainty principle says that because of wave particle duality and quantum superposition it is impossible to know the position and momentum of a subatomic particle at any given moment. Because of this, it is impossible to have a one hundred percent accurate measurement of a particle’s position, something that Generally relativity needs. This means that the two most important and accurate theories ever created can’t work and never have a theory of everything. Now you may be thinking why does General relativity need absolute position anyways, and can’t we just remove the idea that it needs absolute position and have a theory of everything. The answer is kind of but not really this is explained later in Quantum loop theory. But first we will explain why General relativity needs absolute position. General relativity says that when mass is placed in space time fabric it will bend and warp. This space time fabric is smooth and continuous, kind of like a wave. This means that there must be an infinite amount of quantized data between each particle, kind of like an analog wave but with the fabric of spacetime. A basic way to explain this is to imagine you have two particles each suspended in the space time fabric. If you move the two particles together the space between them decreases. General relativity says that no matter how close you move the two particles they won’t change their spots. The particle on the right will stay on the right as long as you keep it on the right and vise versa. This makes sense logically and works very well in the real world, however a problem arises when the two particles are subatomic. At first it would seem that the same principles apply, the particles will move closer and closer and closer but never actually switch position. This however does not happen. If you remember from before, heisenberg's uncertainty principle says that it is impossible to be one hundred percent certain about a particle’s position. It also states that particles exist in all different positions along their quantum waveform. This means that if you moved the two subatomic particles close enough, the quantum wave forms will overlap each other. If the particles were to be measured at this time, their waveforms would collapse and the subatomic particles would have a highly unlikely, but not impossible, probability of switching places. This idea only applies to subatomic particles but still has been proven correct over and over in particle physics experiments. Although it goes directly against General relativity and almost all of our current knowledge of physics, it has still been proven to be correct in particle physics experiments.

<h1  class="header">String theory</h1>
<p id="st"> 
String theory (often called superstring theory) is a theory that describes all fundamental particles as vibrating looped strings, hence the name. String theory says that all fundamental particles are made of vibrating strings of energy, each a planck length long. String theory says that vibrating a string at a certain frequency will produce a certain particle on the standard model of modern particle physics. The standard model is basically a list of fundamental particles divided into two parts, bosons and fermions (and the Higgs field but that’s not an actual particle, it’s a field). You can think of bosons as force carrying like particles. This includes gluons for the strong force, photons for the electromagnetic force, w Bosons for the weak force, the Higgs boson for the Higgs field, and the theoretical graviton for gravity (only correct if String theory is true). Then there are fermions, the actual particles that the bosons interact with, includes quarks and leptons. String theory basically says that all strings are identical to one another. The only differences between each string is the frequency they vibrate at, and what dimensional plain they exist on. For example a string that vibrates for a electron will have its own dimensional range e.g: the sixth dimension. While a muon will vibrate on a fifth dimensional level. It's kind of like quantum field theory just with extra dimensions. However he strings are like the fields and the fields are the now dimensions. If you want a better understanding of string theory click the ted talk link under the sources below. This may not sound like much but string theory is the theoretical solution to the graviton (boson for gravity). Before string theory, physicists tried to add a graviton to the standard model and they got a bunch of infinities. This is because of something called renormalization, where General relativity can’t be renormalized but quantum physics can be. This isn’t important to understand string theory but it’s still good to have some background information. What string theory did is it renormalized the graviton so that now there is a particle that can carry the gravity force. This means the math behind general relativity is already built into string theory. At first string theory seems like a simple theory that could solve the theory of everything. But one could say that string theory comes with a lot of strings attached. For example, since string theory implies higher level dimensions, the math that we use for our easy three dimensional ideas no longer works. In fact the math behind string theory doesn’t even start to work until we apply it to 10th dimensional simulation also we have no way to be expremetly test string theory.

<h1  class="header">Loop quantum gravity</h1>
<p id="lqg"> One theory that tries to fix this is loop quantum gravity. Loop quantum gravity says that general relativity is correct in say that adding mass to space time will cause it to curve. However it also says that space time fabric is not actually infinite but is actually divided into small sections. This small sections are called quanta and are the smallest possible unit of measurement. These quanta are extremely small, around 1x10^-35 meters, each one being one planck length long. Because of this, loop quantum gravity could, in theory unite the two ideas together. This is because space time no longer has infinite precision but instead can be measured in finite chunks. To explain this better let’s go back to the particle analogy described in the above section. If loop gravity is in fact correct then you would not be able to move the two particles closer together and still have an infinite amount of data between the particles. This means that general relativity can now account for quantum superposition. Since space is quantized a subatomic particle can’t have an infinite amount of possible positions but instead can only have a superposition state of all of the possible quantized positions. In turn, this means that when the particle is measured it will now have a definite position creating a theory of everything. if this theory works then why is there no theory of everything. This because its only, a theory, that so far can’t be proven correct or not. This is mainly because we have no way to measure and experiment whether this theory is correct or not. Since we can’t measure planck length with our current technology, we have no way of knowing if planck length space exists and therefore have no way to know if loop quantum gravity is correct.
